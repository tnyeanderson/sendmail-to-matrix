/*
sendmail-to-matrix offers simple interfaces to parse MIME emails, convert them
into a Matrix message, and send them to a Matrix room.

Both encrypted and unencrypted messaging is supported, based on which client
type is used.

This package is primarily used by the sendmail-to-matrix CLI module to which it
belongs.
